**Quilly Crawler** will become a small dungeon crawler game with a round based fighting system
using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).
It uses other open source libraries like [LibKTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx),
[Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley), [Gdx-AI](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai),
[Box2D](https://box2d.org/) or [Gdx-Controllers](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-controllers).

Until it is finished, I will stream every weekend on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/quillraven).
Also, a VLog will be uploaded every sunday on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/Quillraven) channel.
If you are interested, please feel free to subscribe :)
